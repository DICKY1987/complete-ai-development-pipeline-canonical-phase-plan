Phase K Gap Analysis: While Phase K excels at navigation
  (WHERE/WHAT), it lacks decision-making context
  (WHY/WHEN/HOW/WHAT CAN GO WRONG).

  Top 10 High-Impact Additions (Beyond Phase K)

  🔴 CRITICAL (Weeks 1-2)

  1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
    - AI needs to understand WHY decisions were made
    - Prevents proposing already-rejected alternatives
    - 8 essential ADRs identified (workstream model, hybrid
  architecture, SQLite choice, etc.)
  2. Change Impact Matrix
    - "If you change X, you must update Y" mappings
    - Predicts ripple effects before coding
    - Prevents breaking changes
  3. Anti-Patterns & Common Mistakes Catalog
    - What NOT to do
    - Historical bugs and their root causes
    - Component-specific gotchas
  4. Runtime Execution Traces
    - How the system ACTUALLY works (not just design)
    - Real timing data, state transitions, data flows
    - 5 key workflows to trace
  5. Testing Strategy & Pattern Guide
    - How to test changes properly
    - Test patterns for each component
    - Mock/fixture library guide

  🟠 HIGH VALUE (Weeks 3-4)

  6. Dependency Graphs (code + conceptual)
  7. Error Catalog & Recovery Playbook
  8. Data Flow Diagrams (runtime behavior)
  9. Performance Profiles (bottlenecks, optimization
  opportunities)
  10. State Machine Catalog (all valid transitions)

  Quick Win Recommendation

  If you can only do 3 things:
  1. ADRs (biggest bang for buck)
  2. Change Impact Matrix (reduces breaking changes)
  3. Anti-Patterns Catalog (prevents repeated mistakes)

  These provide 80% of value with 20% of effort.

  Expected Impact

  Before:
  - AI decision time: 5-10 minutes
  - Wrong decision rate: ~20%
  - Breaking changes: Frequent

  After:
  - AI decision time: <2 minutes
  - Wrong decision rate: <5%
  - Breaking changes: Rare

  Integration with Phase K

  These don't replace Phase K—they enhance it:
  - K-1 (Index) + Link to ADRs
  - K-2 (Examples) + Annotate with anti-patterns
  - K-3 (Diagrams) + Add execution traces
  - K-4 (Cross-refs) + Link to impact matrix
