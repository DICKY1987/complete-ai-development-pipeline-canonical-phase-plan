# AI Context Configuration - engine/

## Directory Purpose
Job-based standalone execution engine with hybrid GUI/Terminal/TUI architecture.

## AI Indexing Priority
PRIORITY: HIGH
Alternative execution model separate from core/engine/ - important for job-based workflows.

## Scope
ACTIVE_CODE - Standalone execution system with different architecture from core.

## Key Components
- orchestrator.py - Job orchestration
- state_store.py - Job state management
- adapters/ - Tool adapters (aider, codex, git, tests)
- queue_manager.py - Job queue
- worker_pool.py - Worker management

## Architecture Notes
- Uses job JSON pattern (NOT workstream steps like core/engine/)
- Hybrid GUI/Terminal/TUI architecture
- Independent state management
- See engine/README.md for full architecture details

## Import Pattern
from engine.orchestrator import JobOrchestrator
from engine.state_store import StateStore
from engine.adapters.aider_adapter import AiderAdapter
