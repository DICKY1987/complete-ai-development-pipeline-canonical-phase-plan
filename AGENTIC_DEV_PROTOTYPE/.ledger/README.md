# Ledger Directory

This directory tracks the execution history and state of all phases.

Each phase execution creates a ledger entry with:
- Execution start/end times
- State transitions
- Test results
- Error messages (if any)

## Format

Ledger files are named {phase_id}.json and contain execution metadata.
