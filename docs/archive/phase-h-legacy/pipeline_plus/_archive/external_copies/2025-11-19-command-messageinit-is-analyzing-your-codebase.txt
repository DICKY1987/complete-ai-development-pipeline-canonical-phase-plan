  | Aider docs           | docs/aider_contract.md, aider/help/
           | Aider-tuned WORKSTREAM_V1.md                     | Partial
  overlap - pipeline_plus is more refined            |
  | Workstream authoring | docs/workstream_authoring_guide.md
           | WORKSTREAM_V1.1 templates                        | Partial
  overlap - pipeline_plus has tool-specific variants |
  | Coordination         | meta/Coordination Mechanisms/,
  docs/COORDINATION_GUIDE.md | AGENT_OPERATIONS_SPEC
      | Overlap - pipeline_plus consolidates these                 |
  | Tool routing         | Scattered in docs/ contracts
           | # ROUTER_AND_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_COMBINED_SPEC_V1.md | Partial
  overlap - pipeline_plus synthesizes                |

  Unique to Pipeline_Plus

  - AGENT_OPERATIONS_SPEC version1.0.0 - Formalized XML-based spec (new
  format)
  - # Patch Files as Unified Diff & Optimal .md - Patch file documentation
  (no equivalent in parent)
  - # Comprehensive Integration Specification Enhanced Prompt Engineering.md
   - Consolidated prompt engineering spec

  Recommendation

  The pipeline_plus/ directory appears to be:
  1. A consolidation effort - Taking scattered docs from docs/, meta/,
  aider/help/ and synthesizing them
  2. Machine-optimized specs - Structured for agentic AI processing rather
  than human reference
  3. Not pure duplicates - Enhanced/refined versions of existing concepts

  Consider:
  - Moving these consolidated specs to docs/specs/ or similar in the main
  pipeline
  - Deprecating scattered source documents in favor of the consolidated
  versions
  - Updating the parent CLAUDE.md to reference these as authoritative
  sources
