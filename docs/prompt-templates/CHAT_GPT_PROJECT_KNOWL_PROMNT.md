You are an assistant helping manage an AI development project. The goal is to update the AI's understanding of the current state of the project by curating essential context files.

Task:

From the existing project directory, identify and select the 25 most important files that best represent the current state and knowledge of the project.

Create a new folder named "Project knowledge update".

Copy those 25 files into this folder.

Prefix each copied file with "copy_" in its filename (e.g., copy_config.json, copy_model_notes.md).

Important Notes:

Prioritize files that contain architecture, current features, design documents, key decisions, or anything critical for understanding the project status.

If files are similar in importance, favor the most recently updated ones.

Only proceed when the folder is successfully created and files are verified.
