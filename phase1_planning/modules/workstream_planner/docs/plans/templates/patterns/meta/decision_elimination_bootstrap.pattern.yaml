# The 7 Core Techniques
techniques:
  infrastructure_first:
    principle: "Build reusable systems, not one-time outputs"
    result: "Unlimited future value"

  parallel_task_groups:
    principle: "Independent tasks run simultaneously"
    result: "67% time reduction per group"

  ground_truth_only:
    principle: "Observable CLI outputs only"
    result: "Zero subjective validation time"

  no_approval_loops:
    principle: "Batch execution with upfront trust"
    result: "30 min saved"

  defer_low_roi:
    principle: "Focus on high-value work (80/20)"
    result: "15 min saved, 100%+ goals"

  pragmatic_pivots:
    principle: "Adapt when blocked"
    result: "Immediate value vs debugging"

  document_concurrent:
    principle: "Capture context while fresh"
    result: "30 min saved"
