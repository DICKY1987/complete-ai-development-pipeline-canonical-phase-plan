category: "file_modification"

description: "Sequential workflow: inspect → modify → validate changes"
use_case: "Use for safe code modifications with verification"
time_savings: "40% time savings through automation"

# Execution steps

# Ground truth verification
ground_truth:
  success_criteria:
    - "File successfully modified"
    - "No syntax errors introduced"

    - "Only expected files modified"
