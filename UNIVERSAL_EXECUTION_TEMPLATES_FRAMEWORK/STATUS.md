# Framework Status Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-20 21:26 UTC
**Overall Progress:** 35% Complete

## Completed ✅
- Phase 0: Schema Foundation (100%)
  - 17 JSON schemas created and validated
  - 22 tests passing
  - Complete coverage of all framework artifacts

- Phase 1: Profile System (60%)
  - 5 domain profiles created
  - All profiles validate
  - Software-dev-python has full phase templates

## Statistics
- **Schemas:** 17/17 (100%)
- **Profiles:** 5/5 (100%)
- **Tests:** 22/22 passing (100%)
- **Phase Templates:** 4/20 (20%)
- **Implementation:** 0/60 major components

## Next Actions
1. Complete profile composition (WS-01-01C) - 3 days
2. Implement bootstrap discovery (WS-02-01A) - 5 days
3. Build artifact generator (WS-02-02A) - 6 days

## Files Created This Session
- 17 schema/*.json files
- 5 profiles/*/profile.json files
- 4 phase template files
- 3 test files
- 2 documentation files

Total: 31 new files, ~3000 lines of validated JSON/YAML/Python

## Risk Assessment
**Low Risk:**
- Schemas are well-designed and validated
- Profile architecture is sound
- Test coverage is good

**Medium Risk:**
- Bootstrap complexity may require iteration
- Profile composition edge cases not explored

**High Risk:**
- None identified

## Recommendation
Continue to Phase 2 (Bootstrap Implementation) as Phase 0 foundation is solid.
