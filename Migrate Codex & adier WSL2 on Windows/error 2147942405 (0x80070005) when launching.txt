That error is Windows basically saying:

> “I tried to **run** `C:\Users\richg\ALL_AI\Complete AI Development Pipeline – Canonical Phase Plan` as a program, and **access was denied**.”

`2147942405` = `0x80070005` = **ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED**. ([Krisp Help][1])

So:

* Something is **launching** that *folder path* as if it were an EXE,
* and Windows is returning a generic **access denied** startup failure.

Given what you showed earlier, there are *two* likely problems tangled together:

1. The **path itself** is weird (the “dash” is actually an **en-dash**, not a normal `-`).
2. Some tool (Windows Terminal profile, shortcut, script) is using that path in a place that expects a **command**, not a working directory.

Let’s untangle and fix both.

## 1. Verify the folder name & clean it up

First, we want to be 100% sure the folder even exists with the exact characters you think.

1. Open **File Explorer** and go to:

   ```text
   C:\Users\richg\ALL_AI
   ```

2. Find your pipeline folder.

3. **Right-click → Rename**, and change it to something simple like:

   ```text
   Complete-AI-Development-Pipeline-Canonical-Phase-Plan
   ```

   (Just letters, numbers, and `-` or `_`. No fancy dash, no long spaces.)

4. Copy the new path from the address bar so we know it’s correct.

Now test in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\richg\ALL_AI\Complete-AI-Development-Pipeline-Canonical-Phase-Plan"
pwd
```

If that works, the basic path problem is solved.

## 2. Fix anything that is *launching* the folder as a command

That exact error text:

> `[error 2147942405 (0x80070005) when launching "C:\Users\..."]`

is the style Windows Terminal and some other launchers use when they try to **start** something and fail with access denied.

Some common places to check:

### a) Windows Terminal profile

If you created a custom profile:

1. Open **Windows Terminal → Settings**.
2. Select your custom profile (maybe “Codex”, “Pipeline”, etc.).
3. Look at:

   * **Command line** – this must be an **EXE**, e.g.:

     ```text
     C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe
     ```

   * **Starting directory** – *this* is where you put your folder path, e.g.:

     ```text
     C:\Users\richg\ALL_AI\Complete-AI-Development-Pipeline-Canonical-Phase-Plan
     ```

If `Command line` is set directly to the folder path, Windows tries to *run the folder* → `0x80070005`.

### b) Shortcuts or scripts

If you have a `.lnk` shortcut or `.ps1` / `.bat` script:

* In a shortcut:

  * Right-click → **Properties**.
  * **Target** must be something like `pwsh.exe` or `cmd.exe`, *not* just the folder.
  * **Start in** can be the pipeline folder.

* In PowerShell:

  Bad:

  ```powershell
  Start-Process "C:\Users\richg\ALL_AI\Complete-AI-Development-Pipeline-Canonical-Phase-Plan"
  ```

  Good:

  ```powershell
  Start-Process pwsh.exe -WorkingDirectory "C:\Users\richg\ALL_AI\Complete-AI-Development-Pipeline-Canonical-Phase-Plan"
  ```

---

## 3. Permissions sanity check (just in case)

It’s probably not a real permissions issue, but a quick check doesn’t hurt:

1. In File Explorer, right-click the pipeline folder → **Properties** → **Security**.
2. Make sure your user (`richg`) has **Full control**.
3. If your AV pops anything about blocking scripts in that folder, whitelist it.

---

## 4. TL;DR “Do this”

1. **Rename** the folder to a simple ASCII name (no fancy dash).
2. Update any:

   * Windows Terminal profiles (**Command line** = `pwsh.exe`, **Starting directory** = folder).
   * Shortcuts or scripts to use `-WorkingDirectory` instead of trying to “run” the folder.

After that, the `2147942405 (0x80070005)` error for that path should disappear, and we can focus on actually launching Aider / Codex / Claude from that directory.

If you paste the exact command or profile JSON that triggers this, I can rewrite it line-by-line so it “just works” with your new cleaned-up folder name.
