This is a portable stub for: 
  C:\Users\richg\HIGH_LEVEL_MOD_PLUGIN_DEV\AI_MANGER\AIDER_PROMNT&PLAN_REF\Structured Planning Loop (10 steps + gates).txt

Purpose
- Provide the 10-step gated planning loop inline to guide creation of plan/README.md, plan/file-map.yaml, and plan/rtm.yaml.

Notes
- Replace this stub with your full document content when available.
- Keep structure headings intact so Aider can follow the same flow.
