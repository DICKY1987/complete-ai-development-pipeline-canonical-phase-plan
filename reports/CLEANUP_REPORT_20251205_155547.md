- ✅ Moved test results to reports/
- ✅ Converted .txt planning doc to .md

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Improvements

- ✅ Installed pre-commit hook to prevent artifact commits
- ✅ Created archive documentation (README.md)

## Impact Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Root directory files | 131 | ~35 | -73% |
| Storage freed | - | ~3MB | - |
| Archived items | - | 27 files | - |
| Deleted artifacts | - | 57 files | - |

## New Structure

\\\
root/
├── docs/
│   ├── analysis/          # Analysis & planning docs (NEW)
│   ├── guidelines/        # Process guidelines (NEW)
│   └── registry/          # Registry specs (NEW)
├── reports/               # Test & validation reports
├── _ARCHIVE/              # Historical artifacts (organized)
└── cleanup-repo.ps1       # Unified cleanup tool (NEW)
\\\

## Preventive Measures

1. **Pre-commit hook** blocks .pyc, .log, .tmp, nul files
2. **Consolidated cleanup script** with --WhatIf support
3. **Archive README** documents retention policy
4. **Improved .gitignore** enforcement

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Review TODO/DEPRECATED markers (200+ occurrences)
2. Consider automating archive compression (6+ month retention)
3. Add CI check for root directory file count threshold
4. Document new folder structure in main README.md

## Rollback Instructions

All changes are reversible via git:
\\\ash
# Undo file moves (if needed)
git checkout HEAD -- <path/to/moved/file>

# Or restore from archive
cp _ARCHIVE/<timestamped_dir>/<file> ./
\\\
