# AI Context Configuration - tests/

## Directory Purpose
Comprehensive test suite - unit, integration, pipeline, and plugin tests.

## AI Indexing Priority
PRIORITY: HIGH
Tests validate behavior and serve as executable documentation.

## Scope
TEST_CODE - Quality validation and behavior specification.

## Test Organization
- unit/ - Unit tests for individual components
- integration/ - Integration tests across components
- pipeline/ - Pipeline-specific tests
- plugins/ - Error plugin tests
- error/ - Error engine tests
- conftest.py - Shared test fixtures

## Test Runner
pytest -q (config in pytest.ini at root)

## When to Use This Section
- Understanding expected behavior
- Adding tests for new features
- Validating changes
- Debugging failures

## Testing Conventions
- Use pytest framework
- Place tests in appropriate subdirectory
- Mark tests requiring external CLIs/network
- Sandbox repos excluded by default (pytest.ini)
- Keep tests deterministic (no network calls, controlled timestamps)
