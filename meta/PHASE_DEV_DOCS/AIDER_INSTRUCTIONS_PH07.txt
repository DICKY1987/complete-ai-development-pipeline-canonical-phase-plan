TASK: Execute Phase PH-07 Implementation

Please read the complete specifications from PHASE_DEV_DOCS/PH_07_GUI_Layer_and_Plugin_System.md and execute the entire phase implementation autonomously.

IMPORTANT: The project root is the CURRENT DIRECTORY:
C:/Users/richg/ALL_AI/Complete AI Development Pipeline – Canonical Phase Plan

This is the canonical pipeline repository. Ignore any references to "AI_Dev_Pipeline" in the phase document.

Key Steps:
1. Work in the current directory (already the correct project root)
2. Implement all required outputs as specified in the phase document
3. Run all tests to verify implementation
4. Update documentation files
5. Create git commit with message: "feat(ph07): GUI layer and plugin system"

Follow all instructions, constraints, and completion criteria from the phase document.
Make reasonable assumptions where needed and document them appropriately.

Work autonomously without requiring further user input.
