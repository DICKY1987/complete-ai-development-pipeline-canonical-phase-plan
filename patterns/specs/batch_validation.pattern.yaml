# EXEC-002: Batch Validation

## Purpose

Two-pass batch execution (validate all, then execute all) to prevent partial failures

## Context

This is a critical execution pattern from the execution patterns suite, designed to prevent common failure modes in AI-assisted development workflows.

Source file: `patterns/execution/EXEC-002-BATCH-VALIDATION.md`

## When to Use

- Before any operation where this failure mode might occur
- As a standard guard in automated workflows
- In batch operations or multi-step processes

## Implementation

See full pattern specification at: `patterns/execution/EXEC-002-BATCH-VALIDATION.md`

## Verification

**Ground Truth Checks**:
- Pattern prevents the documented failure mode
- Execution time overhead is minimal (< 100ms)
- No false positives blocking valid operations

## Tool Compatibility

- claude_code
- github_copilot_cli
- cursor
- aider

## Related Patterns

- All EXEC patterns work together as a suite
- Combine multiple patterns for robust execution
