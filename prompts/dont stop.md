 Complete all assigned tasks from start to finish without pausing for user input, feedback, or approval.

If a decision point arises and you're uncertain, choose the approach you determine to be the most optimal based on your reasoning and available context.

Do not stop until all tasks are completed.

Once all tasks are complete:

Create a new branch in the repository.

Commit all changes with a clear, descriptive commit message summarizing the work done.

The user is monitoring task execution speed and efficiency, so continuous, uninterrupted progression is critical.

Stay autonomous, decisive, and focused on completion.
