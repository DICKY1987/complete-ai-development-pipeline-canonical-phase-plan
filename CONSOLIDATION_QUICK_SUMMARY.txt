# Autonomous Workflow Consolidation Summary

Date: 2025-12-04
Status: Complete

## What Was Done

1. Analyzed autonomous-workflow/ prototype
   - Found: Not implemented, not running
   - Found: Significant overlap with Phase 6
   - Found: Useful patterns worth preserving

2. Extracted patterns to documentation
   - Created: CERTIFICATION_ENHANCEMENT_PROPOSAL.md
   - Documented: 5 patterns (certification, layers, thresholds)

3. Implemented high-priority enhancements
   - Enhanced: PipelineSummary with auto_repairable tracking
   - Enhanced: PluginIssue with layer classification
   - Created: layer_classifier.py utility
   - Created: thresholds.py for quality gates
   - Updated: pipeline_engine.py with new metrics

4. Archived prototype
   - Moved: autonomous-workflow/ → _ARCHIVE/autonomous-workflow_prototype_20251204/
   - Preserved: All content for reference

## Files Modified
- types.py (enhanced data types)
- pipeline_engine.py (enhanced reporting)

## Files Created
- CERTIFICATION_ENHANCEMENT_PROPOSAL.md
- layer_classifier.py
- thresholds.py
- AUTONOMOUS_WORKFLOW_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md
- CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible

## Testing Needed
- Unit tests for layer_classifier.py
- Unit tests for thresholds.py
- Integration test: verify new metrics in reports

Status: ✅ Complete
