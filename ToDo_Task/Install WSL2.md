 Manual Steps Required (Administrator Access Needed):

  Step 1: Install WSL2
  - Open PowerShell as Administrator (Right-click Start → Windows Terminal (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin))
  - Run: wsl --install
  - This will:
    - Install WSL2
    - Install Ubuntu (default distro)
    - Prompt you to reboot

  Step 2: After Reboot
  - Windows will automatically continue the Ubuntu setup
  - You'll be asked to create:
    - Username: richg (recommended to match your Windows username)
    - Password: (your choice, remember it for sudo commands)

  Step 3: Return Here
  - After Ubuntu is set up, come back and I'll continue with the remaining steps

  Alternatively, if you have a way to run commands with administrator privileges through this interface, let me know
   and I can try to proceed automatically.
