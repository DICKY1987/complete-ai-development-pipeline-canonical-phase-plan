 ✓ Create docs\PHASE_K_DOCUMENTATION_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md (+1295)

 ● Perfect! I've created Phase K: Documentation Enhancement & AI Understanding Improvement plan.

   Summary

   Created: docs/PHASE_K_DOCUMENTATION_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md (37KB)

   What's Included:

   4 Sub-Phases (8-12 days total):

     - K-1: Foundation & Index (Days 1-3)
       - Master documentation index
       - Implementation location mappings for all 47 terms
       - Auto-generation scripts
     - K-2: Concrete Examples (Days 4-6)
       - 5 annotated workstream examples
       - Tool profile examples with inline comments
       - Examples cover: simple tasks, parallel execution, error handling, multi-phase, SAGA patterns
     - K-3: Visual Architecture (Days 7-9)
       - 5 new/updated Mermaid diagrams
       - State machine diagrams (task lifecycle, error escalation)
       - Visual architecture guide document
     - K-4: Cross-References (Days 10-12)
       - Term relationship graphs
       - Bi-directional reference system
       - Auto-generated cross-reference index

   Key Deliverables:

     - DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md - Central navigation hub
     - IMPLEMENTATION_LOCATIONS.md - Every term mapped to code (file:line)
     - 5 annotated examples - Real-world usage with inline explanations
     - 5 visual diagrams - Data flow, tool selection, state machines
     - TERM_RELATIONSHIPS.md - Hierarchical dependency graph
     - Auto-generation scripts - Keep docs fresh via CI

   Success Metrics:

   ✅ AI agents answer "where is X implemented?" in <10 seconds
   ✅ All 47 terms mapped to exact file:line locations
   ✅ Examples execute without modification
   ✅ Visual diagrams auto-validated against code

   The plan is ready for review and execution. Would you like me to also create the Phase L plan for the file cleanup/responsibility tracking system (Part 2)?
