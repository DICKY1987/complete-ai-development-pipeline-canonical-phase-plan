## orchestration_engines: Workstream orchestration and execution
**Question**: Does secondary implementation have unique features not in engine/?

### Primary (KEEP): `engine/`
- Score: 150/200
- Strengths:
  - Canonical path in CODEBASE_INDEX.yaml
  - Most recent commits (last 7 days)
  - High import reference count (137)
  - Full test coverage (100 test files)

### Secondary: `modules/core-engine/`
- Score: 90/200
- Strengths:
  - ULID-prefixed files (62 files)
  - Most recent commits (last 7 days)
- Concerns:
  - Not in CODEBASE_INDEX canonical paths
  - Lower import reference count (0)
  - Partial test coverage
- **Recommendation**: ANALYZE: Determine if modules/core-engine/ has unique functionality not in primary

### Secondary: `UNIVERSAL_EXECUTION_TEMPLATES_FRAMEWORK/core/engine/`
- Score: 50/200
- Strengths:
  - Most recent commits (last 7 days)
- Concerns:
  - Not in CODEBASE_INDEX canonical paths
  - No ULID prefixes
  - Partial test coverage
  - Low documentation
- **Recommendation**: ANALYZE: Determine if UNIVERSAL_EXECUTION_TEMPLATES_FRAMEWORK/core/engine/ has unique functionality not in primary

**Decision**:
- [ ] Archive secondary (functionality is redundant)
- [ ] Keep both (unique functionality exists)
- [ ] Needs investigation

  - ULID-prefixed files (19 files)
  - Most recent commits (last 7 days)

### Secondary: `UNIVERSAL_EXECUTION_TEMPLATES_FRAMEWORK/error/`
- Score: 95/200
- Strengths:
  - Most recent commits (last 7 days)
  - High import reference count (43)
  - Full test coverage (28 test files)
- Concerns:
  - Not in CODEBASE_INDEX canonical paths
  - No ULID prefixes
  - Low documentation
- **Recommendation**: ANALYZE: Determine if UNIVERSAL_EXECUTION_TEMPLATES_FRAMEWORK/error/ has unique functionality not in primary

**Decision**:
- [ ] Archive secondary (functionality is redundant)
- [ ] Keep both (unique functionality exists)
- [ ] Needs investigation

## state_management: State persistence and management
**Question**: Does secondary implementation have unique features not in state/?

### Primary (KEEP): `state/`

### Secondary: `modules/core-state/`
- Score: 95/200
- Strengths:
  - ULID-prefixed files (24 files)
  - Most recent commits (last 7 days)
- Concerns:
  - Not in CODEBASE_INDEX canonical paths
  - Lower import reference count (0)
  - Partial test coverage
- **Recommendation**: ANALYZE: Determine if modules/core-state/ has unique functionality not in primary

### Secondary: `UNIVERSAL_EXECUTION_TEMPLATES_FRAMEWORK/core/state/`
- Score: 55/200
- Strengths:
  - Most recent commits (last 7 days)
- Concerns:
  - Not in CODEBASE_INDEX canonical paths
  - No ULID prefixes
  - Partial test coverage
  - Low documentation
- **Recommendation**: ANALYZE: Determine if UNIVERSAL_EXECUTION_TEMPLATES_FRAMEWORK/core/state/ has unique functionality not in primary

### Secondary: `engine/state_store/`
- Score: 45/200
- Strengths:
  - Most recent commits (last 7 days)
- Concerns:
  - Not in CODEBASE_INDEX canonical paths
  - No ULID prefixes
  - Lower import reference count (4)
  - Partial test coverage
  - Low documentation
- **Recommendation**: ANALYZE: Determine if engine/state_store/ has unique functionality not in primary

**Decision**:
- [ ] Archive secondary (functionality is redundant)
- [ ] Keep both (unique functionality exists)
