> ultrathink, create a plan to identify all automation code

● I'll help you create a comprehensive plan to identify all automation code
  in this repository. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand
  the full scope of automation systems.

● 3 Explore agents finished (ctrl+o to expand)
   ├─ Find automation scripts and utilities · 37 tool uses · 54.2k tokens
   │  ⎿ Done
   ├─ Explore orchestration and bootstrap automation · 34 tool uses · 75.4k
   tokens
   │  ⎿ Done
   └─ Find CI/CD and workflow automation · 53 tool uses · 57.8k tokens
      ⎿ Done

● Now I have a comprehensive understanding of all automation code in this
  repository. Let me write the final plan.

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~\.claude\plans\shiny-gliding-tiger.md

● I've completed a comprehensive plan to identify all automation code in the
   repository. The plan catalogues 400+ automation components across 8 major
   categories:

  Key Findings:

  1. Core Framework (23 components) - Self-configuring orchestration engine
  with bootstrap, scheduling, routing, and resilience patterns
  2. Scripts (350+) - Extensive automation for execution, validation,
  migration, code analysis, GitHub integration, and more
  3. Pattern Executors (100+) - PowerShell implementations for atomic
  creation, testing, module operations, and glossary management
  4. CI/CD Workflows (10) - GitHub Actions for quality gates, documentation
  validation, registry integrity, and automated pattern management
  5. Pattern Automation (15+) - Auto-detection, performance analysis, and
  cleanup
  6. Tool Adapters (30+) - Specification management (guard, indexer,
  patcher, renderer, resolver)

  The plan includes critical file paths, integration points, workflow
  diagrams, and 5 recommended next steps (documentation enhancement, script
  consolidation, automation index, quality improvements, or integration
  testing).
  ⎿  Tool use rejected with user message: no

● I see you'd like to continue working on the plan. What would you like me
  to do next? Some options:

  1. Drill deeper into a specific category (e.g., focus on CI/CD workflows,
  core framework, or specific scripts)
  2. Add different analysis (e.g., dependency mapping, test coverage
  analysis, maintenance burden assessment)
  3. Create supplementary artifacts (e.g., visual diagrams, categorization
  by priority, automation capability matrix)
  4. Focus on specific use cases (e.g., "what automation handles
  deployments?", "what automation manages documentation?")
  5. Different organization (e.g., organize by frequency of use, by
  maintenance priority, by risk level)

  What aspect of the automation code would you like me to explore or
  document further?
